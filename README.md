# Arcade v2
Menu that launches other nested games using subprocesses.

- [Version 1](https://github.com/leerlingenscw/2425-arcade)

Why make a version 2?
I was NOT happy with v1, it didnt fell alive and I was inexperienced. I know I can do better.
Shit had no animations, no sounds, and instead of using python and pygame i used kotlin and libGDX. Should be faster.
